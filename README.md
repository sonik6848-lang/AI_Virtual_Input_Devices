The main objective is to develop an object tracking application to interact with the computer, and 
a virtual human computer interaction device, where in no physical contact with the device is 
required and also to provide an easier human-machine interaction routine. The goal is to manage 
computers and other devices with gesture rather than pointing and clicking a mouse or touching a 
display or keyboard directly. The purpose of this project is to develop a Virtual Mouse and 
Keyboard application that targets a few aspects of significant development.
